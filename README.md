Finally, I'm here to construct a text formatting app using Javascript throughout the learning process.
I had a fresh idea after editing and working on Microsoft Word, and I decided to make Microsift Word based on my littleÂ experience learning JavaScript. and I've included standard text editing functions here, such as Bold, underline, italic, strikethrough, copy, cut, paste, cut, superscript, subscript, text-center, text-left, text-right, undo, redo, and select-all are among the font-setting options.
And depending on my javascript learning phase, I have to create another text-formatting-app functionality eventually.
The html attribute "contenteditable="true" "helps me a lot in creating a division tag that can be used as a writing space. and I'm not using any textarea or input-field tags here. and the contenteditable="true" attribute just finished it.
It's finally time, and I've finished my new text-editing app project successfully.
